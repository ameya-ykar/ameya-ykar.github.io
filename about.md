## About me 

I am a motivated learner with a great passion for the Data Analytics field. I am interested in solving business chellenges using my analytical skills and leveraging organizations by giving them thoughtful insights for their decision making. Currently, I am working as a Decision Scientist in Bluestem Brands. I am working in the cross functional work environment that prompts me to interact with various marketing teams across the board. I build predictive models in order to deliver data-driven solutions that identify points-of-difference in customer behavior, promotional sensitivity, channel shopping preference, and more. Other tasks involve with supporting marketing department through test design and measurement, making R Shiny/Flexdashboard dashboards for analyzing customer survey data by Natural Language Processing, and doing model validation for the Credit Department. 
Occasionally, I research new techniques for statistical model buildings and neural networks to improve model gains. <br><br>

## Goal of my life 

The more I learn more about the Analytics world and meet more people in this field, the more I feel that there is an increasing urgency that we need to support people who do not have access tools to follow up cutting edge technology. As the 4th Industrial revolution progresses, the gap between people who utilize advanced technology and people who cannot follow up technology due to socioeconomic status dramatically enlarges. I am concerned about the unbalanced power in our society and seek possible ways to contribute to lessening the gap using my skills. I especially care about underprivileged youth and want to empower them by providing educational facilities where they can learn powerful skills, such as machine learning and other programming applications. My idea is at initial stage, but it is ongoing..! <br><br>
