<p>Hello there! Welcome to my homepage :)<br><br>

My name is Somang Han (you can call me "So"). I am a Decision Scientist at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/bluestem-brands/">Bluestem Brands</a>, which is a Top 100 Ecommerce company in the US (<a href="https://www.fingerhut.com/welcome/index">Check out one of our brand!</a>)<br>
I am working in the cross functional work environment that prompts me to interact with various marketing teams across the board. I build predictive models in order to deliver data-driven solutions that identify points-of-difference in customer behavior, promotional sensitivity, channel shopping preference, and more. <br>
Other tasks involve with supporting marketing department through test design and measurement, making R Shiny/Flexdashboard dashboards for analyzing customer survey data by Natural Language Processing, and doing model validation for the Credit Department. 
Occasionally, I research new techniques for statistical model buildings and neural networks to improve model gains. <br><br>
  
I graduated from St. Olaf College with a major in Mathematics and a minor in Statistics. During my undergraduate studies at St. Olaf College, I was in the Center For Interdisplincary Research team, which is funded by NSF, and worked on Topological Data Analysis with  <a href="http://www.mrwright.org">Professor Matthew Wright</a> and Professor Matthew Richey.<br>
Also, I joined <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/mnydrg/home">MN Youth Development Research Group</a>, which is led by Professor Michael C. Rodriguez, and worked with graduate students in the Quantitative Methods in Education program from University of Minnesota. <br><br>
 
  
My research interests lie in the intersection of data science and economical behaviors/human behaviors. I love learning new skills (from modeling techiques to hula hooping) and reading books about human behaviors. Some of my hobbies are working on Kaggle Competitions, alpine skiing, and baking. <br>
The goal of my life is to build an institute, where empowers underprivileged youth by providing educational facilities where they can learn powerful skills, such as machine learning and other programming applications. <br><br>
  
I maintain a list of my publications under the <a href="https://somang1418.github.io/research/">Research tab</a>, and a list of other projects under the <a href="https://somang1418.github.io/projects/">Project tab</a>.
